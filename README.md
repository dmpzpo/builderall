# Builderall All-in-One Platform: Save Up To 50% with Promo Codes, 25+ Marketing Tools, Affordable Pricing Starting at $17.90/Month

So you're thinking about building an online business, and suddenly you're hit with a dozen different subscription bills. Website builder here, email marketing there, funnel software somewhere else, course platform... it just keeps going. Your wallet's getting lighter, and you haven't even made your first sale yet.

That's the exact problem Builderall was designed to solve.

Think of Builderall as the Swiss Army knife of digital marketing platforms. Instead of juggling multiple tools and trying to make them all play nice together, you get everything under one roof. And I mean *everything*.

## What Exactly Is Builderall?

Builderall is an all-in-one digital marketing platform that's been around since 2011. It started as a simple tool for new entrepreneurs, but it's evolved into this comprehensive beast that now includes over 25 tools and more than 1,000 features.

The pitch is simple: why pay for five different subscriptions when you can get all those tools in one place?

The platform covers the essentials like website building, email marketing, and sales funnels. But it also includes stuff you might not expect—webinar hosting, chatbots, course creation, CRM, booking systems, even a mobile app builder.

## The Core Features That Actually Matter

Let's talk about what you're actually getting here.

**Website & Funnel Builder**

The Cheetah drag-and-drop builder is Builderall's main website creation tool. It's a true drag-and-drop editor, not just a block builder. You can position elements exactly where you want them, similar to how Wix works.

There are over 400 templates covering different industries and purposes—landing pages, sales funnels, membership sites, you name it. The builder now includes Magic Text AI, which helps you generate content without staring at a blank screen for hours.

**Email Marketing (MailingBoss)**

MailingBoss is Builderall's email platform, and it's surprisingly robust. You get:
- Unlimited email sends on most plans
- Advanced automation workflows with visual path builders
- A/B testing capabilities
- SMS marketing integration (requires Twilio)
- Lead scoring

The workflow automation looks a lot like ActiveCampaign, with features like path splitting and webhooks. Not something you typically find in all-in-one platforms.

**Course Creation & E-Learning**

The e-learning platform lets you build and host online courses. You can drip content, lock lessons, add quizzes, and even gamify the experience with completion tokens and certificates.

It's not as polished as dedicated course platforms, but it gets the job done for most creators.

**Webinar & Live Streaming**

You can host live webinars, record sessions, and even stream simultaneously to your website, YouTube, and Facebook. There's also an "evergreen" webinar feature for automated replays.

**CRM & Chatbot**

Builderall includes a CRM system to manage customer relationships and a chatbot tool for automated customer support. You can capture leads directly through your site and automate follow-ups.

**E-commerce & Checkout**

The "Supercheckout" system handles both digital and physical products. You get inventory management, multiple payment gateway options (Stripe, PayPal, Razorpay, MercadoPago, PagSeguro), and integration with your membership or course access.

**Other Notable Tools**
- Booking and appointment scheduling
- Heatmap analytics (similar to Hotjar)
- URL shortener
- Social media auto-posting
- WhatsApp automation
- Instagram chatbot
- Video hosting
- Mobile app builder

## Current Promo Codes & Discounts (2026)

Based on recent promotions, here are working discount codes:

**🎉 Active Promo Codes:**
- **SAVE50** or **SIMPLYCODES50** - Get 50% off (verified working in 2026)
- 14-day free trial available on Premium plan (no credit card required on some offers)

These codes are typically entered during checkout. The 50% discount has been one of the most consistent offers from Builderall, though availability may vary.

## How Builderall Compares to Competitors

Let's put this in perspective:

**vs. Kajabi**: Kajabi starts at $119/month and is more polished for course creators, but it's more expensive and less feature-rich for general marketing.

**vs. ClickFunnels**: ClickFunnels is significantly more expensive (starting around $147/month) and focuses primarily on funnels rather than being an all-in-one solution.

**vs. Systeme.io**: Systeme.io has a free plan and similar features, making it another budget-friendly option. The two platforms are comparable in pricing.

**vs. Kartra**: Kartra starts at $79/month but lacks dedicated course creation tools.

**The Cost Replacement Argument**

If you were to subscribe to separate tools, you might pay:
- Website builder: $17-$299/month
- Email marketing: $17-$800/month  
- Funnel builder: $147+/month
- Course platform: $119+/month
- Webinar software: $50+/month

Total: Potentially $350-$1,500+/month

Builderall's Premium plan at $87.90/month (or less with promo codes) replaces all of these.

## Real User Reviews: The Good and The Bad

Let's be honest about what users are saying.

**What People Love:**

"I like the fact that once you have Builderall, you don't additional tool to run a successful business. It's full of awesome features and easy to use." - Verified user

"I switched to builderall from clickfunnels, dropfunnels, and kartra... the price coupled with the amount of features made this a no brainer for me." - G2 review

"For the price, it is a worthy contender for sure, and many others charge more for the functionality alone that is free with Builderall." - Verified review

**What People Struggle With:**

"Builderall has gradually become the jack of trades, master of none. You certainly will not use 70% of the features." - Capterra review

"In start it was overwhelming with all tools available." - Multiple users mentioned the learning curve

"Some features have hiccups. For me, the link shortener, there are always upgrades." - User feedback

The pattern is clear: Builderall offers incredible value, but there's a trade-off. You get tons of features, but not all of them are best-in-class. And the sheer number of tools can feel overwhelming, especially for beginners.

## Is Builderall Worth It in 2026?

Here's the thing: Builderall isn't trying to be the absolute best website builder, or the absolute best email platform, or the absolute best course creator.

It's trying to be good enough at all of those things that you don't need to pay for separate subscriptions.

**Builderall is worth it if:**
- You're starting an online business and need multiple tools
- You want to keep costs low while accessing a full marketing stack
- You're willing to invest time in learning the platform
- You value having everything in one dashboard over having the "perfect" tool for each task
- You run multiple websites or businesses (especially on Premium plan with 15 domains)

**Builderall might not be for you if:**
- You need absolute best-in-class tools for specific functions
- You're intimidated by complex platforms with lots of options
- You only need one or two specific tools (like just email marketing)
- You prefer specialized platforms over all-in-one solutions

## Getting Started with Builderall

The best way to test Builderall is through their 14-day trial of the Premium plan. This gives you access to the full feature set without committing long-term.

Here's a realistic starting path:

1. 👉 [Sign up for the 14-day trial](https://builderall.com) using a promo code if available
2. Start with one project—don't try to use every tool at once
3. Focus on the core tools: website builder, email marketing, and checkout
4. Explore additional features as your needs grow
5. Join the Facebook community (30,000+ members) for support

Remember, the platform has extensive training resources, tutorials, and live support to help you navigate the learning curve.

## The Bottom Line

Builderall is like buying a toolbox instead of individual tools. You might not use every single tool, and some tools might not be as fancy as the premium standalone versions, but you've got everything you need in one place at a fraction of the cost.

For budget-conscious entrepreneurs, side hustlers, and small businesses in 2026, it's one of the best-value platforms available. Just be prepared for a learning curve, and don't expect perfection in every category.

The platform keeps improving, adding features, and updating tools. At $17.90 to $87.90 per month (with potential 50% discounts), you're getting access to tools that would typically cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars in separate subscriptions.

Is it perfect? No. Is it worth considering for your online business? Absolutely.

👉 [Start your 14-day trial today](https://builderall.com) and see if Builderall's all-in-one approach works for your business.
